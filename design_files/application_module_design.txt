ERP Module Structure
While you can group them all under "Operations," the best practice is to break them down into more specific, interconnected modules. This makes the system more organized, scalable, and easier to manage.

Here is a standard, professional structure for an ERP:

Finance Module: This is the core of the ERP, handling all financial data.

General Ledger (G/L)

Accounts Payable (A/P)

Accounts Receivable (A/R)

Asset Management

Budgeting & Reporting

Human Resources (HR) Module: Manages all employee-related information and processes.

Payroll Management

Employee Information

Attendance & Leave Tracking

Recruitment

Operations / Supply Chain Management (SCM): This is the group of modules you called the "Business Module." It manages the entire lifecycle of a product. It's best to treat these as distinct, linked modules.

Sales & CRM Module: Manages the customer lifecycle, from leads to sales orders and invoicing.

Procurement Module: Manages all purchasing activities, from purchase requisitions to supplier payments.

Inventory Management Module: Manages all stock, including receiving goods, tracking stock levels, and issuing items to workstations.

Production Module: Manages the entire manufacturing process, from planning and scheduling to production completion.
